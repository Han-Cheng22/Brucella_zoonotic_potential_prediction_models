# *Brucella* strain zoonotic potential prediction models
This repository contains the code and data to reproduce all analyses from the "Machine learning based on pangenome-wide association studies reveals the impact of host source on the zoonotic potential of closely related bacterial pathogens" paper.  
## Requirements
  We recommend using Anaconda3 to create a conda python environment for this project. The environment configuration file **environment.yaml** is provided in the repository.  

  We recommend a computer with the following hardware properties:

RAM: â‰¥16 GB  
  
CPU: Support Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn  

## Usage  
1.Create the conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yaml -n ml-enviroment`  

  
2.Ensure the **Brucella-strain-zoonotic-potential-predict-model.ipynb** and **Data** folder are in the same directory.  

  
3.Notebook to run:   `Brucella-strain-zoonotic-potential-predict-model.ipynb`  

  
4.Execute the notebook cells sequentially.
